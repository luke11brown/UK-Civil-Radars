# UK Civil Radar Data

This repository collates some of the publicly available data about the civil 
aviation radar sites (mostly run by NATS or NERL) in the UK.

The `nerl.csv` file contains data about sites which provide en-route radar (mostly NERL sites).

The `aero.csv` file contains data about sites located at aerodromes which feed the aerodrome ATC services (mostly NATS sites). Note that some aerodrome sites also feed the en-route system.

The `sources.csv` file contains an index of the sources for the data in the previous two CSV files. Indications of which source was used is given by a bracketed number in the previous two CSV files.

Most of the sources used are from wind farm planning documents.
